<p>Primary Investigator: Prof. Michael Ranney, Ph.D.,

<p>We are currently conducting research about how people use 
numbers with regard to base rates that involve a great 
variety of issues and we would like you to consider aiding 
us by participating in this study. This form is provided to 
help you make an informed decision as to whether or not you 
would like to take part in these investigations. Below is 
information regarding what you can expect. Please read it 
carefully; if you have any questions, please contact 
ranney at berkeley.edu. Once you have finished reading the 
form, if you would like to participate, check the box below 
and click on the "Submit" button. Your participation in this 
research is voluntary. You are free to withdraw your consent 
and discontinue participation in this study at any time. If 
you participate throughout this study, you may refuse to 
answer any question(s) that might make you feel uncomfortable 
(e.g., by closing your browser window or typing "I refuse" in 
the appropriate box).</p>

<p>PROCEDURES: If you agree to take part in my research, you 
will answer several questions on a wide variety of topics. We
would like you to make estimates and decisions about the 
topics in quantitative terms. You may be asked to list reasons 
for your estimates. The information will be presented on paper 
or computer and require written responses.</p>

<p>RISKS AND BENEFITS: There are no foreseeable risks associated 
with this study beyond those encountered in routine 
examination and testing. </p>

<p>CONFIDENTIALITY: All information about you and your 
responses will be identified only through a randomly 
assigned identification number. Once we have completed 
the process of collecting data, the key linking your email 
address to this number will be destroyed. At this point, 
it will be impossible to link you to your responses. All 
information will be kept in a locked room.</p>
