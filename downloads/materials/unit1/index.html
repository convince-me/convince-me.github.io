<center><h1>Convince Me Unit 1: Evidence, hypotheses, and theories</h1></center>
<br>

<p>In this unit, we'll talk about distinctions between <b>evidence</b>,
  <b>hypotheses</b> , and <b>theories</b>. Depending upon who you ask, the
  definitions for these concepts can vary greatly. From this section you 
  should be able to get a good understanding of what each concept is even 
  if you may not be able to describe it perfectly in words.</p>

<p>In general, we will define a <b>hypothesis</b> as being a statement that 
  attempts to state what might be true in a particular situation. The word
  "attempts" in the previous sentence is important because some hypotheses 
  accurately describe the segment of reality that they attempt to describe, 
  while other hypotheses can distort, falsify, or misrepresent reality. In 
  other words, some hypotheses are going to be correct while others are not. 
  Here are some examples of hypotheses to help you out: </p>

<p class="example">I will get wet if I don't have my umbrella.</p>

<p class="example">Latrell Sprewell of the Golden State Warriors should be 
  Rookie of the Year.</p> 

<p class="example">Recycling helps the environment. </p>


<p>Hypotheses are the essential units, or building blocks, out of which more 
  complicated descriptions are made. This leads us to the discussion of 
  <b>theories</b>. Theories are collections of hypotheses and <b>evidence</b> 
  (which we will discuss soon). An example of such a theory is the <em>Theory of 
  Evolution</em>. This theory consists of many hypotheses such as: </p>

<p class="example">New species are formed by natural selection. </p>

<p class="example">There is a progressive change, over time, in organisms from
  simple to complex.</p>

<p class="example">Genetic traits are passed from parent to offspring.</p> 

<p><b>Evidence</b> is an extremely important part of any successful theory. 
  Evidence is any body of factual statements on which a belief, idea, or hypothesis 
  is based. Thus, the believability of a hypothesis depends upon the evidence 
  and other hypotheses that support or explain it.</p>

<p>We may believe a hypothesis because it agrees with our own observations
  (evidence), or because other people have reported that they have made 
  observations that agree with, or support, the hypothesis. All evidence is not 
  created equal, though. For instance, the observation that the world appears 
  to be flat (and not spherical) from our viewpoint is usually considered to be 
  weaker evidence than the evidence that we obtain from photographs taken by 
  orbiting satellites. </p>

<p>How good a piece of evidence is partly depends on how the evidence was obtained: 
  Was a reliable method used? How good are the tools that were used to gather or 
  measure the evidence? Can the data be replicated in another experiment? Is the 
  evidence an acknowledged fact or statistic? Is it a reliable memory or observation? 
  Might some reasonable people disagree with the evidence?</p>

<p>It is important to note that, all other things being equal, evidence should
  usually be believed over a contradictory hypothesis––unless the evidence is
  dubious or very unreliable. For example, if a solitary hypothesis contradicts a
  solitary piece of evidence, then that contradicting evidence should be more
  believable than the hypothesis. However, if a hypothesis has a lot of supporting 
  evidence and one solitary piece of contradicting evidence, then the hypothesis might
  be considered to have more truth than the evidence. </p>

<p>For our example of the <em>Theory of Evolution</em> discussed earlier, examples 
  of evidence are: </p>

<ul>
 <li>fossil records</li>
 <li>sickle-cell anemia data (a hereditary disease)</li>
 <li>that human, bird, and reptile embryos share similar features</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exercise 1</h3>

<p>What are the hypotheses (and possible hypotheses) in the paragraph below, and what 
  is the evidence for them? Label the hypotheses and evidence for easy reference; 
  for example {H1, H2, etc.} and {E1, E2, etc.}. Time doesn't matter, so relax and 
  be creative. You can either label them in the text itself, or write them down on 
  the next page.</p>

<p class="example">Mike is an average student (C average). He is taking a physics class, 
  in which he has turned in the homeworks, which are usually about half correct. His best 
  friend, John, is also in the class. John is an excellent student, who is very diligent
  with his studies. John speaks out in class, but Mike does not. Both John and Mike 
  received A's on their midterms. The teacher thinks that Mike may have cheated on the 
  exam, since Mike was sitting next to John.</p>

<p>Hypotheses:</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>Evidence:</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<h2>Relationships between hypotheses and evidence</h2>

<p>In the last part, we talked about differences between hypotheses and evidence.  It 
  is possible for hypotheses to explain other hypotheses, as well as to explain evidence. 
  Sometimes two or more hypotheses together (but not individually) explain a piece of 
  evidence. For example, music coming from a room might be explained by Jeff singing 
  (along), or by Jenny singing (alone). However, a duet cannot be explained by Jeff or 
  Jenny singing alone, but only by them <em>both</em> singing. This sort of explanation
  is termed a <b>joint explanation</b>.  Similarly, hypotheses and/or evidence can 
  contradict each other. Remember that it is possible for one proposition to explain and/or
  contradict more than one other proposition. (A "proposition" or "belief" can be a 
  hypothesis or a piece of evidence.)</p>

<p>The following is an exercise to let you practice determining the relationships between 
  hypotheses and evidence. Remember the following short passage from the last section: </p>

<p class=example>Mike is an average student (C average).  He is taking a physics class, 
  in which he has turned in the homeworks, which are usually about half correct.  His 
  best friend John is also in the class. John is an excellent student, who is very diligent 
  with his studies.  John speaks out in class, but Mike does not.  Both John and Mike 
  received As on their midterms. The teacher thinks that Mike may have cheated on the 
  exam, since Mike was sitting next to John.</p>

<h3>Exercise 2a</h3>

<p>Draw a diagram representing the relationships between the (evidential and hypothetical) 
  propositions you labeled in Exercise 1.  Use a solid line to connect a proposition that 
  explains another, a dashed line for beliefs that are in conflict, and converging lines 
  for beliefs that jointly explain another proposition. (Glance at the example diagram 
  three pages ahead if you are confused.)</p>

<p>Your diagram:</p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p> From your diagram, what seems to be the most believable, coherent theory (or set of 
  beliefs)? Why?</p>

<br><br>

<h3>Exercise 2b</h3>

<p>Are there other factors, not present in the text, that might need to be taken into 
  account?  If so, what are they, and how would they affect your previous reasoning? </p>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<p>Add these new factors to your diagram, in a different color pen.</p>

<h3>Exercise 2c</h3>

<p>Based on this new diagram, what are the most reasonable conclusions you can form?</p>

<br><br><br><br><br>

<h2>An example analysis</h2>

<p>The following pages include one possible analysis of the above situation.  Compare 
  your analysis with the following, and be sure that you understand the differences.  
  If you feel that your analysis needs refining, go ahead. But, remember that your analysis 
  does not need to be the same as the one below.</p>

<p>Tanya lists some possible hypotheses and evidence for them:</p>

<p class=example>H1: Mike cheated off of John's exam.<br>
  H2: Mike did not cheat.<br>
  H3: John cheated off of Mike's exam.<br>
  H4: John did not cheat.<br>
  H5: No one cheated on the exam.</p>

<p class=example>E1: Mike scored much lower on previous exams.<br>
  E2: Mike and John sat beside each other.<br>
  E3: John received an A on the exam.<br>
  E4: Mike received an A on the exam.<br>
  E5: John is a very good student.</p>

<p>Here is Tanya's set of explanatory and contradictory relationships between the hypotheses 
  and evidence:</p>

<p class=example >H1 and E3 explain E4</p>

<p class=example >E1 explains H1</p>

<p class=example >H1 explains E2</p>

<p class=example >H3 explains E2</p>

<p class=example >H3 explains E3</p>

<p class=example >H5 explains H2</p>

<p class=example >H5 explains H4</p>

<p class=example >E5 explains H4</p>

<p class=example >E5 explains E3</p>

<p class=example >H1 contradicts H2</p>

<p class=example >H1 contradicts H5</p>

<p class=example >H3 contradicts H4</p>

<p class=example >H3 contradicts H5</p>

<p>Here is Tanya's diagram of the relationships between the hypotheses and evidence. 
  In our convention, we have the things that do the explaining above the things they 
  explain. You'll notice that we put arrows in the direction of the explanation. You might 
  want to go back and add arrows to your diagram (and any future diagrams), too. You don't 
  have to write out your text in the diagram, like we do here. You can just use your labels.  
  We're just writing out the text here for your ease.</p>

<p class=example><img width="495" height="339" src="cheat1.gif"></p><br>

<p>Tanya thinks that no single hypothesis has overwhelming support:</p>

<p class=example>&quot;Both H1 and H3 seem possible. It is difficult to rule out H5, because 
  of the notion of 'innocent until proven guilty.'</p>

<p>Tanya tries to think of other ideas that might be important for understanding what 
  happened. She came up with the following:</p>

<p class=example>H6: Mike may have studied for the exam.</p>

<p class=example>H7: Mike may have finally gotten over his test anxiety.</p>

<p class=example>E6: No one saw anyone cheat.</p>

<p>Here are Tanya's additional explanatory and contradictory relationships between the 
  hypotheses and evidence:</p>

<p class=example>H5 explains E6</p>

<p class=example >H6 and H2 explain H2</p>

<p class=example >H7 explains E4</p>

<p>And here is Tanya's new diagram, with new beliefs in boldface:</p>

<p class=example><img width=502 height=339 src="cheat2.gif" ></p><br>

<p>Based on this new diagram, Tanya may conclude: </p>

<p class=example>&quot;H1, H3, and H5 all have support, but the evidence is still not 
  conclusive. It's not clear that we have an argument strong enough to accuse anyone of 
  cheating.</p>

<h3><b>Exercise 3</h3>

<p> Consider the following passage, list the hypotheses and evidence. What hypotheses could 
  be infered from this new information? Add them (along with any explanatory and contradictory 
  relationships), with a different color pen, to your diagram.</p>

<p class=example>John's girlfriend, Mary, is also in the physics class.  Mary is a solid B 
  student, but she did very poorly on the exam. Mary and John had studied for the midterm 
  together and were sitting next to each other during the exam.</p>
